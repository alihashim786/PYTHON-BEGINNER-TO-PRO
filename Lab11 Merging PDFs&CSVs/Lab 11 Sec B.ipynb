       "\" OXFORD BROOKES UNIVERSITY School of Engineering, Computing, and Mathematics Module COMP6032 Artificial Intelligence, Semester 1 2023/2024 Coursework: Robo-Uber In this project you will develop a simplified system for an automated taxi service, including both  the agents (the 'taxis') and the central dispatcher. The taxis will have a map of the service area,  although it should not be automatically assumed that all routes shown are passable (due to  roadworks, obstructions etc). You will be asked to consider planning, search, constraint  satisfaction, and reasoning in both certain and uncertain environments Learning Outcomes 1. Identify where AI techniques are relevant for a particular problem and apply them to develop  solutions. 2. Design and construct software artefacts that employ AI techniques 3. Critically evaluate the success of employing AI approaches in a modern business context Introduction This project has 3 main components: the simulated service area: a 'net world' with marked roads,  a central dispatcher which receives requests for service and bids from taxis, and schedules taxis  appropriately, and each taxi itself. The service area comes pre-built, but you will be expected to  design and build core components of the intelligent agents for both the taxis and for the  dispatcher. You will start with some skeleton code which gives you a very primitive, deterministic   system, and you will develop this into an efficient system that maximises the return to the  dispatcher and the taxis. In the environment, users of the service ('fares') appear at random and indicate a destination to  be taken to. It may be assumed that they will pay the requested amount on arrival, but if a taxi  does not arrive at their location within some fare-specific interval (unknown to both dispatcher  and taxis, but which may be assumed to depend strongly upon quoted price), they will drop the  request. Fares will also drop the request if the quoted amount (by the dispatcher) is exorbitant:  over 10 times the expected time to their destination in minutes. Taxis, the dispatcher, and fares  all have access to real-time information from the world which gives them a (conservative)  estimate of time to destination. Time in the environment advances in steps of minutes (these are not 'real-time' minutes: a  'minute' of environment time will elapse in a second of real time). Roads are divided into  segments, each of which can only take 1 taxi in each direction. Each segment takes 1 minute to  traverse when there is no traffic; there is an option to add traffic (that you can set with  trafficOn = True  in RoboUber.py) which mean some roads or intersections may become  congested or blocked and require more time to traverse. Intersections may have up to 8 roads  leading in or out of them; a turn is permitted in any direction, but there is a traffic light system  that manages access. All of this is handled automatically in the drive function provided in the  taxi agent. Some intersections can take more than 2 taxis, and may have a higher traffic capacity;   this usually means also that more fares will call for a ride from these points. It is the responsibility of the dispatcher to select which taxi gets a given fare, to determine the  price for the requested journey, to issue fare requests to taxis, giving starting and final  destination (along with any cancelled fares), and to coordinate bids for fares by taxis. The  dispatcher collects a fixed 10% per fare transported. The taxis, meanwhile, are responsible for route selection and for deciding whether to bid for a  given fare. A taxi may bid for a fare (but are not required to bid) regardless of whether they are  currently conducting another fare to a destination, but they must send their location to the  dispatcher along with their fare bid. Taxis may bid on any number of fares they choose, but the  dispatcher selects which taxi to assign to a given fare and the fare price. Taxis receive the price of   their fare minus the 10% to the dispatcher. However, taxis also lose £1/minute whether  conducting a fare or idle. Taxis start with £256; if they reach £0 they go off duty for the rest of the   day. You start with 4 taxis, but you can experiment with more, or with a higher starting account  balance. The RoboUber world. The 4 taxis appear at the edges as red, black, blue, and green dots. Fares are   the orange triangles. The tasks The taxis and the dispatcher have been fitted with a very simple deterministic system for route  planning, fare allocation, and fare bidding. You should not assume these work perfectly or are  bug-free (this is part of the exercise)! You will have 3 tasks to complete during this coursework to   improve these functions, with opportunities for extensions for extra marks. The coursework is  worth 50% of the module mark. Each task is given with its percentage of the module total. 1) (20%) In this first part you will consider the impact of path planning.     a) Run the system over several simulated 'days' and evaluate the results. Consider the average         return to each taxi and to the dispatcher, the joint return of the operation (total revenue to         all parties), and the number of taxis that remain on duty as a function of the time of day.        (5%)     b) Modify the _planPath function for the taxi agent to produce a more efficient, optimum route         plan and analyse its results against the previous results. You should conduct the analysis         over the same time you used for the initial evaluation in 1a. Motivate your choice of path         planner. (10%)     c) For further marks, you could construct a probabilistic path planner which considers path         planning with traffic estimates and plans paths according to estimated journey time. If you         implement this, likewise analyse the results and evaluate the impact (if any) on fare drops         (i.e, when a fare cancels because it has been waiting too long). (5%) 2) (10%) So far, you have improved the system only through changes to the taxi behaviour. Now,      you will improve the dispatcher.      Modify the _allocateFare function to schedule taxis so as to maximise the total returns at the      end of the day to the taxis and the dispatcher. The crucial considerations here are how quickly      the taxi can service the fare, how many bids must be in to allocate, and how to service      allocation reasonably fairly. Perform an analysis of the returns and taxi schedules before and      after the changes to _allocateFare. (10%) 3) (20%) In the last part you will update the bidding routines on the taxi and possibly the     dispatcher.     a) Modify the taxis' _bidOnFare function to maximise its expected return. Consider the         deterministic time-to-location case with no traffic and the probabilistic case where there is         traffic. Analyse actual results against expected results for at least 3 trials. (10%)     b) Evaluate how successful such a system could be in commercial deployment and assess which         parts of the system would need further experimental testing and live trials to modify the         system for production. (5%)     c) You could also modify the dispatcher's _costFare function to maximise the probability that         each fare will be transported (i.e. minimise the likelihood that a fare will cancel). This will         involve probabilistic reasoning over both the fares and the taxis. Consider how such a         bidding and dispatch system might be used in a commercial environment. (5%) Submission Guidelines Your analysis and evaluation should be submitted as a report of no more than 3000 words  through Moodle by Friday, Week 12.  All source code must be submitted through a repository to be   provided by the University. Regular commits to the repository are expected and are part of the  assessment criteria: clear evidence of progress on a daily or weekly basis will receive  (significantly) higher marks than, e.g. no tangible evidence of progress until 2 days before the  submission deadline followed by a sudden jump in commit activity. This is reflected in the  rubrics, which should be consulted before submission. Any submission which cannot show  evidence of substantive commits consistent with reported progress, will be capped to 40% of  marks available for those components where associated code is not present in the repository. Feedback Students will have the opportunity to gain formative feedback in Week 5 and Week 10. You will  be asked to show your current implementation and analysis. In Week 5, only the deterministic  components in Tasks 1 and 2 will be evaluated; in Week 10 the probabilistic components will also  be evaluated and commented upon. Final submissions will be capped to twice the higher of the 2  marks achieved on the formative assessments, but in no case will they receive less than the  formative mark. So, for example, if the first formative submission received a 47%, and the second  formative submission received a 45%, the maximum mark available would be a 94% and the  minimum mark would be a 45%. Note, however, the cautions regarding plagiarism indicated  below, which could result in a reduction of marks below any formative mark achieved . Assessment The assessment will consider the following aspects of your work:  \\uf0b7The basic functionality for each task \\uf0b7The quality and originality of the implementation \\uf0b7General coding practice and documentation \\uf0b7Depth and insight of evaluation and analysis This is individual work. Submissions will be checked for plagiarism both in the code and in the  analysis. You may use the numpy and pygame external libraries, and some tools introduced as  part of the practical sessions, but note in particular that you are not permitted to use third-party  libraries that provide pre-written or 'black-box'-like artificial intelligence functionality. This  includes automatically generated code from chatbots or IDE assistants. Any task realised with  such libraries will receive 0 marks. \""
